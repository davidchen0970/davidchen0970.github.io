# Disable auto-formatting for Hugo templates in VS Code

If you've been frustrated by Visual Studio Code's auto-formatting feature removing your carefully arranged indentations in Hugo templates files, you're not alone. Here's a quick guide to stop this from happening and preserve your desired formatting.

## Problem

When working with Hugo templates, auto-formatting can remove the indentation, making the code less readable. For example:

### Input:
```handlebars
{{ range ... }}
   {{ if .... }}
      {{if ... }}
          <tag></tag>
      {{end}}
   {{end}}
{{end}}
```

### Output After Auto-Format:
```handlebars
{{ range ... }}
{{ if .... }}
{{if ... }}
<tag></tag>
{{end}}
{{end}}
{{end}}
```

This behavior can make complex templates hard to read and maintain. To fix this, you can disable auto-formatting specifically for Handlebars files.

## Solution

### Disable Auto-Formatting for Handlebars in VS Code

You can turn off auto-formatting for Handlebars files while keeping it enabled for other file types.

#### Steps:
1. Open VS Code's settings:
   - Click on **File > Preferences > Settings** (or **Code > Preferences > Settings** on Mac).
   - Alternatively, press `Ctrl + ,` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + ,` (Mac).
2. Search for `editor.formatOnSave` and disable it for specific files by adding the following configuration in your `settings.json`:



3. Add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:

   ```json
   "[handlebars]": {
     "editor.formatOnSave": false
   }
   ```

   This setting ensures that auto-formatting is disabled for Handlebars files, identified by `.hbs` or `.handlebars` extensions.
